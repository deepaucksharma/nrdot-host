- **Component Integration**: Clean integration between supervisor, config-engine, and API using direct function calls
- **Common Module**: Well-structured shared interfaces and models in `nrdot-common`
- **Blue-Green Reload**: Properly implemented zero-downtime configuration updates
- **Provider Pattern**: Excellent use of interfaces for extensibility

### Areas for Improvement
- Standalone API and collector modes are not yet implemented (stub functions return "not yet implemented")

- Some circular dependency risks between supervisor and config-engine

### Architecture Score: 90/100

## 2. Code Quality Analysis

### Strengths
- **Clean Structure**: Well-organized codebase with clear separation of concerns
- **Error Handling**: Consistent use of wrapped errors with `fmt.Errorf`
- **Logging**: Structured logging using zap throughout
- **Interface Design**: Good use of interfaces for testability and extensibility
- **Naming**: Clear, consistent naming conventions

### Issues Found
- Only 2 TODO/FIXME comments (in test files) - excellent completion
- Missing error handling for some API response encoding
- Inconsistent context cancellation in some goroutines
- Some duplicated code between processors could be refactored

### Code Quality Score: 88/100

## 3. Testing Coverage

### Test Infrastructure
- **40 test files** across the project
- Comprehensive integration tests in `integration-tests/`
- E2E test scenarios covering major use cases
- Security-focused tests for secret redaction
- Performance benchmarks for critical paths

### Coverage Gaps
- No unit tests for unified binary (`cmd/nrdot-host/main_test.go`)
- Missing tests for standalone API and collector modes
- Limited edge case testing for reload strategies
- No chaos/failure injection tests
- Missing load tests for API endpoints

### Testing Score: 75/100

## 4. Documentation Audit

### Comprehensive Documentation
- **User Guides**: 10+ guides covering installation, configuration, deployment
- **Technical Docs**: Architecture, API reference, troubleshooting
- **Development**: Contributing guide, processor development
- **Operations**: Performance tuning, monitoring setup

### Documentation Gaps
- Migration guide from v1 to v2 missing (noted as "first release")
- Limited troubleshooting scenarios
- Missing detailed processor configuration examples
- No video tutorials or architecture diagrams
- Incomplete API authentication documentation

### Documentation Score: 92/100

## 5. Security Review

### Security Strengths
- **Secret Redaction**: Comprehensive patterns in `nrsecurity` processor
- **No Hardcoded Secrets**: Clean codebase verified
- **Secure Defaults**: Local-only API binding, TLS requirements
- **Permission Handling**: Proper user separation and privilege management
- **Input Validation**: Good validation throughout

### Security Gaps
- TLS not enforced by default for API server
- No rate limiting on API endpoints
- Missing authentication/authorization for API
- No security headers in API responses
- Limited audit logging

### Security Score: 85/100

## 6. Performance Analysis

### Performance Achievements
- **Memory**: 40% reduction (500MB → 300MB)
- **Startup**: 63% faster (8s → 3s)
- **Reload**: 50x faster (5s → <100ms)
- **CPU**: 60% reduction in idle usage
- **Processes**: 80% fewer (5 → 1)

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (1-2 days)
1. Create Dockerfile for unified binary
2. Implement API authentication
3. Add unit tests for main binary
4. Update Docker Compose for v2

### Short Term (1 week)
1. Implement standalone modes
2. Add metrics endpoint
3. Create operational runbooks
