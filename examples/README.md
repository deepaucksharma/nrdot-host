## Quick Start

1. Choose an example that matches your use case
2. Copy the configuration files to your deployment directory
3. Customize the settings according to your requirements
4. Follow the deployment instructions in each example's README

## Configuration Hierarchy

All examples follow this configuration precedence:
1. Environment variables (highest priority)
2. Configuration file (`nrdot-config.yaml`)
3. Default values (lowest priority)

## Common Customizations

### Data Sources
```yaml
sources:
  - type: kafka
    config:
      brokers: ["localhost:9092"]
      topics: ["events"]
```

### Processors
```yaml
processors:
  - type: filter
    config:
      expression: "status == 'active'"
  - type: transform
    config:
      mapping:
        user_id: $.userId
        timestamp: $.eventTime
```

### Outputs
```yaml
outputs:
  - type: elasticsearch
    config:
      hosts: ["localhost:9200"]
      index: "events"
```

## Performance Considerations

- **Memory**: Allocate at least 2GB for basic deployments
- **CPU**: 2+ cores recommended for production
- **Storage**: Fast SSD storage for write-heavy workloads
- **Network**: Low-latency connections between components
