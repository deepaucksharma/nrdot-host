# Documentation Alignment Summary

## Work Completed

This document summarizes the documentation alignment work completed to bring NRDOT-HOST documentation in sync with the strategic vision of becoming New Relic's canonical Linux telemetry collector.

### 1. Repository Reorganization ✅

Moved documentation to proper directory structure:
```
docs/
├── architecture/
│   └── ARCHITECTURE.md (renamed from ARCHITECTURE_V2.md)
├── roadmap/
│   ├── ROADMAP.md (new)
│   ├── PROJECT_STATUS.md (moved)
│   ├── PHASE_CHECKLISTS.md (new)
│   └── IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md (new)
├── auto-config/
│   ├── AUTO_CONFIGURATION.md (moved)
│   └── baseline_schema.json (new)
├── migration/
│   └── INFRASTRUCTURE_MIGRATION.md (moved)
└── config-schema/
    └── config.yaml.tmpl (new)
```

### 2. Documentation Updates ✅

#### README.md
- Removed performance improvement claims (40% memory reduction)
- Clarified current v2.0 capabilities vs future plans
- Updated roadmap to 4-month timeline with specific phases
- Marked auto-configuration as Phase 2 (not current)
- Added implementation status section
- Fixed installation instructions

#### ARCHITECTURE.md
- Removed "3-6 months" vague timeline
- Added clear phase breakdown with weeks
- Removed multiple reload strategies (only blue-green)
- Added platform notes about Linux-only focus
- Clarified what's implemented vs planned

#### AUTO_CONFIGURATION.md
- Added "Phase 2" status - not yet implemented
- Updated security section for Phase 2 timeline
- Corrected service list to initial 5 services
- Removed advanced features from initial scope
- Added schema_version to baseline format

#### PROJECT_STATUS.md
- Removed v1.0 comparison metrics
- Updated timeline from "3-6 months" to specific 4-month plan
- Added concrete deliverables per phase
- Removed "production readiness score"
- Added next steps and sprint planning

#### INFRASTRUCTURE_MIGRATION.md
- Marked as Phase 3 feature
- Clarified current manual migration only
- Updated feature comparison table
- Removed promises of automatic features
- Added timeline expectations

#### CONTRIBUTING.md & SECURITY.md
- Added Linux-only development policy
- Removed cross-platform references
- Updated repository URLs
- Added focus areas for contribution

### 3. New Documentation Created ✅

#### ROADMAP.md
- Detailed 4-month implementation plan
- Phase 0: Foundation (2 weeks)
- Phase 1: Process Telemetry (4 weeks)  
- Phase 2: Auto-Configuration (6 weeks)
- Phase 3: GA & Migration (4 weeks)

#### PHASE_CHECKLISTS.md
- Week-by-week engineering tasks
- Exit criteria for each phase
- Success metrics
- Risk tracking

#### IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md
- Clear mapping of implemented vs planned
- Feature compatibility table
- CLI command status
- Development priorities

#### baseline_schema.json
- JSON schema for service discovery
- Version 1.0 specification
- Required fields defined

#### config.yaml.tmpl
- Complete configuration template
- Current vs future options marked
- Environment variable placeholders

### 4. CI/CD Integration ✅

Created `.github/workflows/docs-check.yml`:
- Validates documentation structure
- Checks for outdated references
- Ensures Linux-only focus
- Validates JSON schemas

### 5. Key Clarifications Made

1. **Version Strategy**:
   - v2.0.x: Current unified architecture
   - v2.1.x: Enhanced process telemetry (Phase 1)
   - v3.0.0: Auto-configuration GA (Phase 2&3)

2. **Timeline**: 
   - Total: 4 months (not "3-6 months")
   - Clear week allocations per phase

3. **Feature Reality**:
   - Auto-configuration: NOT implemented (Phase 2)
   - Service discovery: NOT implemented (Phase 2)
   - Migration tools: NOT implemented (Phase 3)
   - Process telemetry: Basic only (enhanced in Phase 1)

4. **Platform Focus**:
   - Linux-only going forward
   - Removing cross-platform code
   - No Kubernetes operator
   - Traditional host monitoring

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. Run `git status` to see all changes
2. Review modified files
3. Commit documentation updates
4. Begin Phase 0 implementation tasks

### Phase 0 Tasks (This Week)
1. Remove Windows/macOS build targets from Makefile
2. Update CI/CD for Linux-only
3. Delete cross-platform code files
4. Create Phase 1 design document

## Summary

The documentation now accurately reflects:
- Current v2.0 capabilities (unified binary, manual config)
- Clear 4-month roadmap with concrete phases
- What's actually implemented vs planned
- Linux-only strategic direction
- Realistic timelines and deliverables

All promises of "automatic" features are properly marked as future Phase 2/3 work, preventing user confusion and setting accurate expectations.
