# Root Directory Cleanup Summary

## Actions Taken

### 1. Created Organization Directories
- `scripts/` - For all executable scripts
- `test-reports/` - For test results and coverage reports
- `archive/` - For archived/unused content

### 2. Moved Files to Appropriate Locations

#### Scripts → `scripts/`
- `install.sh` → `scripts/install.sh`
- `quickstart.sh` → `scripts/quickstart.sh`
- `test-all.sh` → `scripts/test-all.sh`
- `run-tests-simple.sh` → `scripts/run-tests-simple.sh`

#### Demo Files → `demo/`
- `demo-simple.sh` → `demo/demo-simple.sh`

#### Test Reports → `test-reports/`
- `E2E_TEST_REPORT.md` → `test-reports/E2E_TEST_REPORT.md`
- `TEST_RESULTS.md` → `test-reports/TEST_RESULTS.md`
- `TEST_SUMMARY.md` → `test-reports/TEST_SUMMARY.md`
- `INTEGRITY_SUMMARY.md` → `test-reports/INTEGRITY_SUMMARY.md`
- `coverage.txt` → `test-reports/coverage.txt`

#### Archived Content → `archive/`
- `clean-platform-implementation/` → `archive/clean-platform-implementation/`
  - This appears to be a separate project that was copied in
  - Contains its own complete infrastructure setup
  - Removed all `.Zone.Identifier` files before archiving

### 3. Cleaned Up Windows Metadata
- Removed all `.Zone.Identifier` files from the archive directory

## Current Root Directory Structure

Now the root directory contains only essential files and directories:

### Essential Files
- Core documentation: README.md, LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING.md, SECURITY.md
- Project documentation: CLAUDE.md, DEPENDENCIES.md, PROJECT_STATUS.md, etc.
- Build files: Makefile, .gitignore
- CI/CD: .github/

### Component Directories
- All `nrdot-*` component directories
- All `otel-processor-*` directories

### Supporting Directories
- `docs/` - User and developer documentation
- `examples/` - Example configurations
- `docker/` - Docker build files
- `kubernetes/` - K8s manifests and Helm charts
- `systemd/` - System service definitions
- `scripts/` - All executable scripts
- `test-reports/` - Test results and coverage
- `demo/` - Demonstration files
- `archive/` - Archived content

## Benefits

1. **Cleaner Organization**: Scripts and test results are now in dedicated directories
2. **Easier Navigation**: Root directory is less cluttered
3. **Better Separation**: Clear distinction between core files and supporting content
4. **No Windows Artifacts**: Removed unnecessary .Zone.Identifier files
5. **Archived Unclear Content**: Moved potentially unrelated project to archive

## Note on References

The .gitignore file already includes patterns for:
- `test-results/` (which covers our test-reports directory)
- `coverage.txt` and other test artifacts

No changes to documentation references were needed as the original files didn't contain direct references to the moved scripts.
