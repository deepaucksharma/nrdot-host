# NR Enrich Processor Implementation Notes

## Overview

The NR Enrich processor has been successfully implemented with the following features:

### Core Features Implemented

1. **OpenTelemetry Processor Interface**
   - Full support for traces, metrics, and logs
   - Implements all required processor lifecycle methods
   - Thread-safe processing with proper error handling

2. **Metadata Providers**
   - **System Provider**: Collects hostname, OS, architecture, CPU count
   - **AWS Provider**: EC2 instance metadata via IMDS
   - **GCP Provider**: Google Cloud metadata via metadata service
   - **Azure Provider**: Azure VM metadata from environment variables
   - **Kubernetes Provider**: Pod/namespace metadata from downward API

3. **Enrichment Features**
   - Static attribute injection from configuration
   - Environment metadata collection with caching
   - Resource attribute enrichment
   - Conditional enrichment rules (structure in place)
   - Dynamic attribute computation (structure in place)

4. **Performance & Reliability**
   - Metadata caching with configurable TTL
   - Graceful error handling
   - Configurable timeout for external calls
   - Thread-safe operations

### Dependencies Note

The following dependencies have been temporarily commented out to allow standalone compilation:
- `github.com/newrelic/nrdot-host/nrdot-privileged-helper` - For process metadata
- `github.com/newrelic/nrdot-host/otel-processor-common` - For common interfaces

These can be re-enabled once the dependencies are available.

### Features Ready But Not Active

1. **Process Metadata Collection**
   - Code structure is in place for privileged helper integration
   - Will provide process ID, user/group, command line, environment variables
   - Uncomment the helper client code when the dependency is available

2. **CEL Expression Evaluation**
   - Structure for conditional rules using CEL expressions is ready
   - Implementation can be added in `applyRules` method

3. **Dynamic Attribute Transformation**
   - Structure for dynamic attribute computation is ready
   - Implementation can be added in `applyDynamicAttributes` method

## Testing

All unit tests are passing:
- Enricher creation and configuration
- Trace, metric, and log enrichment
- Metadata providers (system, Kubernetes, Azure)
- Attribute value type handling
- Factory and processor lifecycle

## Configuration Example

See `example_config.yaml` for a comprehensive configuration example demonstrating all features.

## Next Steps

1. Enable privileged helper integration when available
2. Implement CEL expression evaluation for rules
3. Add dynamic attribute transformation logic
4. Add integration tests with real cloud environments
5. Performance benchmarking and optimization
