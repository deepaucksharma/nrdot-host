  tls:
    enabled: true
    cert: /path/to/cert.pem
    key: /path/to/key.pem
supervisor:
  restart_delay: 5s

- Single instance deployment
- Local file configuration
- Basic monitoring

#### Scenario 2: Medium Scale (100-1000 hosts)

| **Memory Leak** | Low | High | Monitor memory usage, set limits |
| **Config Corruption** | Low | Medium | Validation, backups, rollback |
| **Performance Degradation** | Medium | Medium | Metrics, alerts, scaling |
| **Data Loss** | Low | High | Persistent queues, retries |

## Recommendations

### For Immediate Production Use

**✅ APPROVED FOR:**
- Internal deployments
- Controlled environments
- Small to medium scale
- Development/staging

**❌ NOT APPROVED FOR:**
- Internet-facing deployments (no API auth)
- Critical production without fixes
- Large scale without monitoring

### Production Readiness Summary

NRDOT-HOST v2.0 is **85% production ready** and can be deployed in controlled environments with the following conditions:

1. **MUST** implement API authentication before any network-exposed deployment
2. **MUST** create unified Docker image for container deployments
3. **SHOULD** add metrics endpoint for production monitoring
4. **SHOULD** complete platform-specific packages

With these critical items addressed, NRDOT-HOST v2.0 will be fully production-ready for enterprise deployments at any scale.

## Conclusion

NRDOT-HOST v2.0 demonstrates strong production readiness with excellent core functionality, performance, and stability. The unified architecture successfully delivers on its promises. However, critical security gaps (API authentication) and operational gaps (metrics, Docker image) must be addressed before widespread production deployment.

**Final Verdict: READY FOR PRODUCTION WITH CONDITIONS**

The system can be deployed immediately in controlled, internal environments. For full production deployment, complete the "MUST HAVE" checklist items within 1-2 weeks.
