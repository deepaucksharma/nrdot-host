# Clean Platform Implementation Roadmap

This document provides a detailed implementation plan for building a production-ready platform on New Relic's infrastructure, following all security and compliance requirements.

## Overview

The implementation follows a phased approach over 20 weeks, ensuring each component is properly integrated with New Relic's platform services: Grand Central, Container Fabric, GitHub Enterprise, Jenkins-in-Docker, Vault, and managed databases.

**Critical Requirement**: NO direct AWS access. All infrastructure must be provisioned through Grand Central, Container Fabric, and Tim Allen.

| 4 | Infrastructure Ready | Databases provisioned, Vault configured |
| 6 | Core Services Deployed | Data collection operational |
| 8 | Platform Features Complete | Feature flags, load balancing active |
| 10 | Security Compliant | All policies enforced, certs automated |
| 12 | Fully Observable | Monitoring, alerting, SLOs in place |
| 14 | Multi-Cell Active | Running in multiple production cells |
| 16 | Database Optimized | Scaled, replicated, cached |
| 18 | Fully Automated | CD pipeline, hooks, rollbacks |
| 20 | Production Ready | Load tested, documented, trained |

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Cell capacity**: Reserve capacity early with capacity council
- **Database performance**: Start with over-provisioned instances
- **Certificate issues**: Test cert-manager thoroughly in staging
- **Deployment failures**: Implement comprehensive rollback procedures

### Process Risks
- **Access delays**: Submit team-permissions early
- **Approval bottlenecks**: Engage stakeholders early
- **Knowledge gaps**: Schedule training sessions
- **Integration issues**: Test all integrations in staging

## Success Metrics

- **Deployment frequency**: Multiple times per day
- **Lead time**: < 1 hour from commit to production
- **MTTR**: < 15 minutes
- **Availability**: > 99.9%
- **Security compliance**: 100% policy adherence

## Next Steps

1. Create TeamStore entry (Day 1)
2. Submit team-permissions PR (Day 1)
3. Create GitHub organization (Day 2)
4. Bootstrap Jenkins instance (Day 3)
5. Register with Grand Central (Day 4)
