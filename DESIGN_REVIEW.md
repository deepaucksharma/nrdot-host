2. `otel-processor-nrenrich` (metadata injection)
3. `otel-processor-nrtransform` (calculations)
4. `otel-processor-nrcap` (cardinality limits)
All use `otel-processor-common` for shared functionality ✓

#### Self-Monitoring Integration
**Design:** Self-instrumentation with health reporting
**Implementation:** ✓ Complete chain
```
nrdot-ctl → nrdot-telemetry-client → NrdotHealthSample events
                    ↓
            nrdot-health-analyzer → KPI Dashboards
                    ↓
            nrdot-cost-calculator → Optimization
```
